# 1. Return Profile

**Objective**: Return an object in console like so:

```JSON
{
  "profile": {
    "name": "Chanda K. Chaudhary",
    "employer": {
      "name": "Scholastic Inc.",
      "title": "Quality Czar",
      "address": "1271 6th Avenue, New York"
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

* This object concatenates the users first name, middle name initial and last name
* It also nests an object with the profile object for the "employer"

# 2. Profile Function

**Objective**: Make a function that returns an *new* object like so:

```JSON
{
  "profile": {
    "name": "Chanda K. Chaudhary",
    "employer": {
      "name": "Scholastic Inc.",
      "title": "Quality Czar",
      "address": "1271 6th Avenue, New York"
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

* The function should be called like so `functionName( data1, data2, ... )`
* When the function is called it returns a *new* profile object for that profile
